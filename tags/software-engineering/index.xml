      <description>Intro This is the second post of Road to Simplicity. And it&amp;rsquo;s about the role of tests in software writing.&#xA;(The first part is about the goal of the series and hexagonal architecture)&#xA;Test and correctness I think that it&amp;rsquo;s inappropriate to associate test with verification of correctness. After all with a test we can verify that a software module (e.g. a function) returns an expected output with a given input.</description>

      <description>Intro Software writing taught me that: a well written software is a simple software.&#xA;So I started to think how to achieve simplicity in a methodological way. This is the first post of a series about this methodology.&#xA;Naturally it&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot because it&amp;rsquo;s in constant evolution.&#xA;Simplicity A definition of simplicity is:&#xA;The quality or condition of being easy to understand or do.&#xA;Oxford dictionary (https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/simplicity)&#xA;So, a simple software is a software that is easy to understand.</description>
