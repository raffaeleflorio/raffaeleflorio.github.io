      <description>Intro This is the only challenge I solved in the Signals section.
It’s been solved 59 times and it was worth 965 points.
Description:
 Here’s a log of some kind of network traffic. The BASH script will help you set up your tools, and probably give you a hint as to what kind of network this is.
 You can download the log here.

 The hash seems a salted MD5.
The correct hash mode is md5($salt.$pass). So with hashcat:
