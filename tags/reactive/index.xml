      <description>Intro This is the second post of Road to Simplicity. And it&amp;rsquo;s about the role of tests in software writing.
(The first part is about the goal of the series and hexagonal architecture)
Test and correctness I think that it&amp;rsquo;s inappropriate to associate test with verification of correctness. After all with a test we can verify that a software module (e.g. a function) returns an expected output with a given input.</description>

      <description>Intro Software writing taught me that: a well written software is a simple software.
So I started to think how to achieve simplicity in a methodological way. This is the first post of a series about this methodology.
Naturally it&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot because it&amp;rsquo;s in constant evolution.
Simplicity A definition of simplicity is:
 The quality or condition of being easy to understand or do.
Oxford dictionary (https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/simplicity)
 So, a simple software is a software that is easy to understand.</description>
