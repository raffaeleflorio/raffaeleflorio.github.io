      <title>Road to Simplicity: Hexagonal Architecture [Part One]</title>

      <description>Intro Software writing taught me that: a well written software is a simple software.
So I started to think how to achieve simplicity in a methodological way. This is the first post of a series about this methodology.
Naturally it&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot because it&amp;rsquo;s in constant evolution.
Simplicity A definition of simplicity is:
 The quality or condition of being easy to understand or do.
Oxford dictionary (https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/simplicity)
 So, a simple software is a software that is easy to understand.</description>

      <title>Cosa significa contribuire alla cultura hacker?</title>

      <description>Hacker e dubbio Col tempo ho eguagliato la cultura hacker alla cultura del dubbio.
Dunque contribuire alla cultura hacker significherebbe contribure alla cultura del dubbio. E immagino che, solo questo, non significhi molto.
A tal proposito partirei dalla relazione fra hacker e dubbio.
Chi è un hacker? Una definizione di hacker che va dritta al punto è:
 Un hacker non è altro che una persona che ama capire come funzionano le cose.</description>

      <title>What does it mean to contribute to the hacker culture?</title>

      <description>Hacker and doubt Over time I matched the hacker culture with the culture of doubt.
So contributing to the hacker culture would mean contributing to the culture of doubt. But I guess this doesn’t mean a lot.
In this regard, I would start from the relationship between hackers and doubt.
Who is a hacker? A definition of hacker that goes straight to the point is:
 A hacker is nothing but a person who loves to understand how things work.</description>

 You can download the log here.

      <description>Salty This challenge was solved 148 times and it was worth 357 points.
Description:
 You might need this: 1337
Hash: 5eaff45e09bec5222a9cfa9502a4740d
NOTE: The flag is NOT in the standard auctf{} format
 The hash seems a salted MD5.
The correct hash mode is md5($salt.$pass). So with hashcat:
$ hashcat -a 0 -m 20 salty rockyou.txt ..... 5eaff45e09bec5222a9cfa9502a4740d:1337:treetop ..... Crack Me 2 This challenge was solved 108 times and it was worth 880 points.</description>

      <description>Intro Some time ago, a friend of mine (dag-tech), asked me about a technique to run a shellcode with NX enabled. So he gave me a simple program:
//src.c #include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt; int main(int argc, char **argv) { char buf[16]; puts(&amp;#34;Can you pwn me????&amp;#34;); read(0, buf, 512); return 0; } $ gcc -z noexecstack -fno-stack-protector -o vuln src.c $ checksec vuln Arch: amd64-64-little RELRO: Partial RELRO Stack: No canary found NX: NX enabled PIE: No PIE (0x400000) The approach The issue with NX is that we cannot execute code in writable memory segment.</description>
